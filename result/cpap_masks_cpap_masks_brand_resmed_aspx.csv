</div>
From the maker of the popular Mirage Swift II CPAP nasal interface, ResMed has designed the ResMed Swift LT CPAP nasal interface to be lighter, quieter, more adjustable, and more comfortable than the Mirage Swift II. 
At the time of its release, the Swift LT is the only CPAP nasal pillows product on the market that features both a patented rotating pillows support and dual-wall pillows that can be adjusted to accommodate various nasal angles.<br><br>
The dual-wall pillows sit on a flexible base, allowing vertical and lateral movement without compromising seal, and are designed to reduce symptoms of dryness by limiting the volume of air entering the nostrils. In addition, the outer pillow inflates with air while the inner pillow offers a soft, stable support.
<br><br>
With the ResMed Swift LT being 71% quieter than the ResMed Swift II this CPAP nasal interface has proven to be ResMed&apos;s most popular nasal pillows CPAP mask. ResMed has included Small, Medium, and Large nasal pillows to support most CPAP users.  The soft silicone pillows reduces nasal irritation and dryness resulting in a more comfortable and better nights sleep.  The ResMed Swift LT CPAP nasal interface can be used with both BiPAP and CPAP therapy and can be used with any CPAP therapy pressure, however it is recommended for pressures of 4 to 20 cmH2O.  For longevity of the ResMed Swift LT, proper cleaning is recommended.  Replacement parts are available and can be found by clicking on the parts tab.

For CPAP patients who are active sleepers, the ResMed Mirage Activa nasal CPAP mask has proven to be an excellent choice. This mask is also great for any CPAP or BiPAP users who have pressures higher than 12cm/H2O. The Mirage Activa Nasal CPAP Mask uses ActiveCell Technology to automatically adapt to the changing positions of active sleepers. It allows the mask frame to move independently of the cushion, which helps the CPAP cushion stay in place and maintain a seal during movement at night.<br><br>
The 4 point CPAP headgear and the quick release elbow makes this a perfect CPAP mask for those who frequently get up at night.  For proper fitting of this mask, tighten forehead headgear straps and leave lower headgear straps loose. After adjusting the headgear, the pressure from your machine will &quot;inflate&quot; the ActiveCell Technology  CPAP Mask cushion providing an excellent seal.<br><br>ResMed remains the leader in CPAP mask and CPAP interface development.  They always apply patient input to everyone of their CPAP Mask designs.<br><br>

<div id=""quickfacts"">
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clear line of sight - The smaller frame design allows the user to see well, without the normal obstruction in a full face design. The smaller style also makes side-sleeping more comfortable.</li>
<li>Built-in vent design - The proven ResMed vent design disperses air quietly and gently.</li>
<li>Flexible and durable mask frame - The Quattro FX has a sturdy enough design to remain stabilized on the face, but it is flexible enough to accommodate the user&apos;s movements during sleep.</li>
<li>360-degree elbow rotation - Allows ease of tubing positioning; avoid bothersome tubing snags or pulls while sleeping.</li>
<li>New, improved tension-reducing headgear design - Resolve pressure point pain with this new design by ResMed.</li>
<li>Dual-wall spring air cushion - A soft silicone cushion with two layers that inflates like a balloon to provide a comfortable and flexible seal around any face shape.</li>
<li>Set-and-forget headgear clips - Easy to release headgear clips on both sides of the mask ensure that mask removal is easy and adjustment-free.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Just when we thought ResMed couldn&apos;t outdo their very popular Mirage Quattro, they surprised us with the debut of the ResMed Quattro FX Full Face CPAP Mask. This ResMed full face CPAP mask builds on the proven platform of the original Mirage Quattro, adding new features to deliver an even more comfortable and lightweight full face CPAP mask solution.<br><br>
The ResMed Quattro FX allows full face CPAP mask users something most masks cannot - a clear field of vision. It&apos;s lightweight and unobtrusive design means not only is the mask more comfortable to sleep in, it&apos;s also easier fit, easier to clean, and easier to wear. <br><br>
Many CPAP users find the adjustment to a full face mask to be a bit more difficult due to the larger size of the mask and the area it covers on the face; the ResMed Quattro FX lessens the anxiety that can come with wearing a full face mask. The minimal weight of the mask combined with the comfort design proven in ResMed masks and cushions means that problems associated with claustrophobia, tearing masks off while sleeping, non-compliance, and more can be relieved.<br><br>
The ResMed Quattro FX Full Face CPAP mask has a built in quick release to allow CPAP users to get up during the night, without having to remove their CPAP mask, as well as having easy to release headgear clips that allow the mask to be removed quickly and without having to worry about readjusting headgear. <br><br>
This CPAP mask is excellent for mouth breathers, and can be used with CPAP and BiPAP therapy at any pressure setting. Replacement cushions are available for longevity of your ResMed Quattro FX CPAP Full Face mask.<br><br>
